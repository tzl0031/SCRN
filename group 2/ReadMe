DATA preprocessing:
DBLP data is downloaded from DBLP website and is preprocesses by python program.
Youtube data is downloaded from Lei Tang's website and it is in Matlab format.

Algorithm implemented in Matlab. Scalable kmeans is implemented in C++. Mex compiler makes it callable my Matlab.

The project includes:
	Data: DBLP from DBLP website.
	      youtube.mat
	python: DBLP data preprocessing
	Matlab function: main.m
			 edgeclutering.m
			 evaluation.m
			 Keep_prediction.m
			 scalable_kmeans.
			 SCRN_RL.m
			 Calc_nodeW.m
			 Calc_prob_cp.m
	C++ program: scalable_kmeans.cpp
	Need to use mex compiler to build a executable file that is callable by Matlab.

How to run: main.m
